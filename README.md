## Install
Feel free to install using GitHubs recommended clone methods or by downloading the code and opening it in your preferred text editor. Once installed use `npm i` to download dependencies.

## Requirements
You need a text editor of your choice, both the inquirer npm and jest, and a browser to view your creation.

## Tests
Tests can be run using npm test

## Summary
This application takes in user input and displays it on an html page. The user can put as many engineers or interns as they please. The questions are asked using [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), and the tests are done via [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest). To run the program input `node index.js` into the command line and answer the prompts.
